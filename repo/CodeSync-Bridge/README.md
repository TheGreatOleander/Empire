A revolutionary tool to unify Android devs. Create Magisk module repos and XDA posts in one shot, then walk away as the community ignites.

## Manifesto
CodeSync is the spark for Android’s open-source soul. Drop this seed, watch it grow, and transcend the grind. Unify XDA and GitHub—hack, share, vanish!
